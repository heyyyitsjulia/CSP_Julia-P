# Julia Properzi, silly sentences C

# empty string variables for user words (minimun 3)
adjective =input("Tell me a adjective\n")
verb = input("Tell me a verb\n")

    #A welcome for the user telling them what the program is (print)

    #ask user for words (print statement with a question scanf to set to variable) (in C we need to tell the user that they only type 1 word)

    #print out the story with the variables inserted ("welcom %s to my program", name)
