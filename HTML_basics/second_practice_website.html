        <h1>CSP review</h1>
        <p>So far, CSP has been a good class and I have learned a lot of things from it. I didn't really enjoy the programming unit, I didn't understand it and I didn't do very well on it, but I am liking the other units that we are doing. I am actually starting to look foward to coming to class which is a big step for me and I feel like I am getting smarting and gaining more knowledge every day. I like doing the activities that we do to better understand the topic that we're learning about, it makes the class more fun. My favorite units, one being my favorite and three being my least favorite are... </p>
