        <h1>Italy</h1>
        <h2>Language</h2>
        <p>In Italy they speak Italian. Italian is a romance language that is Latin based. Some other languages that are similar to Italian is Spanish, French, Romanian, and portugese. Something that makes the Italian language different from English, is that it uses the masculine and feminine form (which most other romance languages do as well). Italian isn't only spoken in Italy though, it is also spoken in some small parts of Switzerland, France, Croatia and Slovenia. Italian also has many different dilects, depending on where in Italy you go. Different words are said in different ways, and some dilects are so unique, it's like learning a whole other language! </p>
        <h2>Food</h2>
        <p>Italy has many very good foods rooted in Etruscan and Roman traditions. Depending on where in Italy you go, you get different types of food. For example, the North is known for butter-based dishes and rice, while the South has tomatoes, seafood, and citrus fruits. The Renaissance period introduced new ingredients from the New World, like corn, potatoes, peppers, and tomatoes, which inproved the Italian cuisine. Some popular italian dishes are, Pizza, Pasta, Risotto,<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minestrone"

            target = "_blank">Bruschetta</a> and Gnocchi. Pizza, with its origins in Naples, became a symbol of Italian culinary adjustment. Cities near the coast enjoy making seafood, like mussels (cozze), shrimp (gamberetto), oysters (ostriche), and many more. They tend to put them into pastas and soups, to enrich the flavor. </p>
