        <h2>Survival</h2>
        <p>To survive, there are many things that the giant panda has to, first of which is eating bamboo, which is 99% of their diet, they spend 14 hours a day eating, so thats their main past time. They have unique wrist bones to grasp and crush bamboo. They also climb trees for protection from other animals or certain weather events/ things that could harm them. In certain areas, their black and white pattern can help the camouglage from other predators.
